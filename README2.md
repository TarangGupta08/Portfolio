##STEPS USED IN CREATING THIS WEBSITE

(1) Createyour project's repository. Login to our GitHub account and go to https://github.com/new or click the New repository icon from your account homepage.

(2) Name your repository username.github.io, replacing username with your GitHub username. Be sure it is public and go ahead and tell GitHub to create a README file upon generating the repo.

(3) Create an index.html page by clicking the plus icon next to your repository name and typing the file name directly in the input box that appears.

(4) Commit index.html. At the bottom of the page, there is a text input area to add a description of your changes and a button to commit the file.

(5) To style the content go back to your repository home and create a new file named css/main.css.

(6) Now deploy your website.

(7) Share the repository link and git.io pages.
