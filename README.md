# THINGS I LEARNED WHILE CREATING THIS WEBSITE
(1) Nothing makes me happier than when I have to update someone else’s code to find out it’s written it in a reusable way.

(2) Nurture a world of problem solvers.

(3) Try and do it right the first time.

(4) Become a more rounded developer.

(5) Invest the time to write your own functionality as it will pay you back eventually.

(6) Being a good programmer, in my opinion, is being able to solve problems.

(7) Test it, and test it again.Test your code…thoroughly

(8) Invaluable if you’re working in a team, and worthwhile if you’re working solo.

(9) There will always be somebody who will know (or think they know) more about a subject than you.
